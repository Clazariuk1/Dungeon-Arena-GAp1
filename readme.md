Summary:

An arcade-style survival game in which you survive endless waves of enemies. Intended as an exploration in collision detection and how to challenge the player through multitasking and hand-eye coordination.

initial concept:

What if it was an action game with RPG elements - you move a player box around screen and avoid enemy boxes always trying to damage on collision with the player box. Player box can attack with click-based methods while enemy box is damage on collision only. Youâ€™d face small enemies and Big enemies classes with different skins across a couple different levels. The primary game mechanic is avoiding on collision damage while clicking enemies to death. Enemies spawn on level up and even the act of moving causes you to gain XP and level, necessitating strategy in how you intend to maintain your gameplay momentum.

Initial pseudocode:

As it fleshes out : you move a box that is bound within the borders of a container.
1: ENABLE BOX MOVEMENT
2: ENABLE BORDER COLLISION DETECTION / BOUNCE-OFF WALL
3: ENABLE enemy box / player Box collision detection
4: delete enemy box, subtract 1 playerBox health after collision detection
5: propagate enemy boxes at random throughout container space. All must gravitate toward player . OR, if this is too difficult, all must move at random directions. Points lost and block deleted for border walls or player box hit.
6: Enemies destroyed with click-based attack or kill all active boxes.


Base game instructions: You're an adventurer trapped in a nightmarish dungeon from which there is no escape. Survive the continuous
onslaught of enemies. Be warned! Colliding with enemies will damage you, and enemies colliding with the
border walls will also damage you!
    -Start game by selecting 'new game' button
    -Avoid contact with enemies using the WASD keys
    -Attack by clicking on the enemy boxes
    -Heal yourself with the 'e' key

Next Steps:
    -Deploy images for player and enemy boxes.
    -Deploy additional player powers and abilities, such as 'dash' speed boost, 'slipstream' turn invincible mode, and 'Lightning Strike', eradicate all enemies on screen at great MP and HP expense.
    -Deploy additional enemy types, with different/new powers, movement speeds, and health quantities.
    -Deploy additional levels with alternate music and backgrounds.
    -Deploy difficulty choice selection which will affect player/enemy box sizes and movement speeds.
    -Sleep.
